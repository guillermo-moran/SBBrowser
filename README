One of my many unreleased tweaks which will probably never see the light of day. This code is just here for reference and educational purposes ;-)


SBBrowser = A web browser anytime, anywhere! Search and open web pages no matter where you are with a simple activator gesture!


FYI, this tweak really sucks and I never finished it. It's also buggy and has a shitty UI. If you have a problem with it, FORK IT AND SUBMIT YOUR CHANGES. It's pointless though, really.
